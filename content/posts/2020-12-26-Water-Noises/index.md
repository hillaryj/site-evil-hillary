BLUF (bottom line up front): nothing ended up being wrong, but this morning was a TRIP!

I brought Belle in from an outdoor adventure and, as soon as we walked in, I heard something weird. When I took off my winter hat (it is winter today at 27F), the sound resolved into water spraying-and-dripping noises.

Which is, y'know a real bad thing to be happening in or under your house.

So, I walk around a little to see if I can figure out more where it's coming from but no.

I stick my head out a window and the water noises fade and the only thing I can hear is the neighbors' heating unit fan and the wind through dry leaves.

I come back in and _there it is again_, so I grab the water valve tool and go out and turn the water off. I stop by the crawl space access and turn on the crawl space lights, but I don't see any water anywhere... huh. Maybe it's the far garden faucet?

I go back inside and keep sleuthing after verifying that the kitchen faucet has lost pressure.

No change in the water noise, wtf?

It's definitely not a fan noise, there is distinct dripping.

It gets stronger near a wall that has no water lines... WTF???

Then I realize... I'm wearing a hoodie and my phone is in the front pocket. At some point during the dogventure, the screen turned on and opened my sleepytime noises app...

To RAIN NOISES!!!

It's not the setting I usually sleep to so I didn't recognize it, and it got louder near walls because they were reflecting the sound back to me.

...

I turn back on the water to the house.

The end.
